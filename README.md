# MNPS Pathways: A Parent Tool

## Project Motivation
As the Dean of Community Life at Nashville Prep, I've spent the last two years working to ensure our school is fully enrolled with 5th through 8th grade students. I've made thousands of phone calls and talked to hundreds of students and parents in an attempt to develop a deeper understanding of what drives a parent to enroll or unenroll their child from a school. While there are many factors, I found that indvidiual academic performance is the core of the parent's school choice. Will my student be successful academically at your school? Will they excel in their classes? Will they be on track to be competetive for college applications?

## So - what do parents see when it comes to schools within Metro Nashville Public Schools (MNPS)?
